Interactive command-line chess game implemented in Python.
To play execute 'python Chess.py'
Should run properly from the command line on windows and unix machines...
Graphics will change and possibly not look right unless font is lucida console for unix OS and Fixedsys for windows while the background colour should be white (if black, colours are simply inverted).

The AI implemented here is very simple, performing a random move on a random player.
