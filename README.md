Interactive command-line chess game implemented in Python.
Should run properly from the command line on windows and unix machines...
Graphics will change and possibly not look right unless font is:
	unix: lucida console
	windows: Fixedsys
and the background colour is white (if black, colours are simply inverted).

The AI implemented here is very simple, chosing random moves.
